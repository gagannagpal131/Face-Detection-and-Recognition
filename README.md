# Face-Detection-and-Recognition
Facial detection and recognition using OpenCV on Raspberry Pi

The system code is designed to be used on Raspberry Pi. OpenCV is used for
the process of face detection and recognition. Face detection is implemented
using the Haar Cascade file and the face recognition is implemented using Local
Binary Pattern Histogram.
The user presses the capacitive touch sensor which prompts the camera module to
capture an image, the image is processed using the detection and recognition
algorithms. The image is scanned through the system's face database and
the output is shown on the OLED display connected to the Raspberry Pi

Note : Additional files have been provided to work on a computer and also for
code module(s) testing purposes.
